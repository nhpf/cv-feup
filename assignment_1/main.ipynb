    "The quality assurance tester of a M&M factory retrieves a sample from the production every hour to determine some properties of chocolate peanuts. The factory uses a computer vision application to automatically calculate some properties of the sample, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    " - the distribution of each color in the sample, e.g., the number of red (or blue or …) chocolates. At the end, if the sample does not have chocolate peanuts of all colors, the system must raise an alarm by printing \"Color XPTO is missing\".\n",
